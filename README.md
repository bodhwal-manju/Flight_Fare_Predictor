<h2>🤜Overview</h2>
This project aims to predict flight prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately forecast the price of flights based on various features such as departure time, airline, route, and other relevant factors.

<h2>📊Dataset</h2>
Training Data and Test(Unseen) data are provided in the Repository

## 🧐Project Various Step

### Data Exploration
I started exploring datasets using pandas, NumPy,matplotlib, pandas profiling and seaborn.

### Model Selection
Built many Models and out of that i have selected RandomForest Regressor.

### Hyperparameter Optimization
Using Randomizedsearch CV and GridSearch CV to select the best parameter for training the model

### Model Dump
As per selected trained model is dumped to pickled format for app development

### Model Accuracy 
75.2%













<h2>🛠️ Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. Clone this repository</p>

```
https://github.com/bodhwal-manju/Flight_Fare_Predictor.git
```

<p>2. Navigate to the project directory:</p>

```
cd Flight_Fare_Predictor
```

<p>3. Create Virtual Environment(Using venv (Python 3 built-in module))</p>
